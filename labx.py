In this problem your task is to plot two functions and
graphically find the intersection points of the two functions.

The first functions is $$ f(x) = \sqrt{""" + f"{k:.1f}" + r"""x} $$ and 
the second function is $$ g(x) = (x - """ + f"{c:.2f}" + r""")^2 $$.
    
First, plot the two functions in the same graph. Make this first plot to show the functions in the 
larger range of $x$ values, say $x \in [0, 10]$.

Then plot the two functions in another graph, but now show the functions in the smaller range of 
$x$ values. In this second plot, make sure to show the intersection points of the two functions.
What are their values? Find the values *graphically*.

Finally, remember to decorate the plots with title, axis labels, and a legend. Add also grid
lines to the plots to make them easier to read."""
